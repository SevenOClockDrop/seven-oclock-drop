  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 30, 2025</p>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>SevenO'Clock Drop</strong>, a daily sweepstakes dApp built exclusively for the Pi Network community. By accessing or participating in the app, you agree to the following Terms of Service. Please read them carefully.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>SevenO'Clock Drop is a ritualized sweepstakes experience operated on the Pi Network. Pioneers may acquire entries for a chance to win a portion of a community-funded prize pot. The service is intended for entertainment and engagement within the Pi ecosystem.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>Participation is limited to verified Pioneers—members of the Pi Network. Only Pioneers may log in, claim the daily free entry, and participate in the draw. If a non-Pioneer is referred to the app, they will be prompted to sign up for Pi Network before participating. By entering, you confirm that you are not violating any local laws or regulations regarding sweepstakes or digital currency use.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entries:</strong> Pioneers may claim one free entry per day and purchase additional entries using Pi (currently Test-Pi) at the rates specified in the app.</li>
      <li><strong>The Draw:</strong> A randomized draw is conducted daily at approximately 7:00 PM Pacific Time.</li>
      <li><strong>The Prize:</strong> 95% of the total Pi collected is awarded to the winning Pioneer. The remaining 5% is retained as a platform fee to support development, maintenance, and future improvements.</li>
      <li><strong>Payouts:</strong> All transactions are conducted via the Pi blockchain (currently Testnet). Payouts are sent directly to the winner’s wallet.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Testnet Phase</h2>
    <p>SevenO'Clock Drop currently operates on the Pi Testnet. All Pi exchanged and awarded is Test-Pi, which holds no real-world value. This phase is intended for testing, demonstration, and community feedback.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Pioneer Conduct</h2>
    <p>Pioneers agree not to misuse the app. This includes—but is not limited to—exploiting bugs, attempting to manipulate the draw, or interfering with platform operations. Violations may result in permanent exclusion from the app.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Winner Display</h2>
    <p>To ensure transparency, winning Pioneer UIDs may be publicly displayed on the app’s dashboard and history pages. These identifiers are anonymous and do not reveal personal information. If you prefer not to be listed, you may request anonymization through the Pi ecosystem.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
    <p>SevenO'Clock Drop is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted service, error-free operation, or specific outcomes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service periodically. Continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions or concerns regarding these terms, please contact the project creator, <strong>@cherylochoa</strong>, through the Pi Network ecosystem.</p>
