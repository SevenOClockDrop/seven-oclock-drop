That is an excellent and very responsible question.The short answer is: No, you do not need a Terms of Service right now, but it is a very good idea to have one.The Pi Developer Portal checklist lists the Terms of Service as optional. The Privacy Policy is the only one that is strictly mandatory. However, having a ToS makes your app look more professional and protects you by setting clear rules for your users.Since your app involves a sweepstakes/draw and the exchange of Test-Pi, having a simple ToS is a smart move. It manages user expectations and defines the rules of the game.Let's create one. Just like the Privacy Policy, we can make it simple, clear, and host it as a new page.Part 1: Your Terms of ServiceHere is a template I've written specifically for SevenO'Clock Drop. It covers the key rules of your app.Terms of Service for SevenO'Clock DropLast Updated: August 27, 2025Welcome to SevenO'Clock Drop! By using our application, you agree to these Terms of Service.
