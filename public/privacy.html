Privacy Policy for SevenO'Clock Drop  
Last Updated: August 30, 2025

Thank you for participating in SevenO'Clock Drop, a daily sweepstakes dApp built exclusively for the Pi Network community. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle information within the app. Our goal is to maintain transparency while collecting only the minimum data necessary to operate the platform securely and fairly.

1. Information We Collect  
When a Pioneer accesses SevenO'Clock Drop, we collect the following:  
• Pi Network User ID (UID): This is a unique, anonymous identifier provided by the Pi Network during login. It allows us to create and manage your entry record within our system. We do not collect or store your Pi username, real name, email address, phone number, or wallet credentials.

2. How We Use Your Information  
Your UID is used solely for the following purposes:  
• To Operate the App: We use your UID to track your entry count and distinguish your account from other Pioneers.  
• To Manage Entries: Your UID is associated with purchased entries, referral bonuses, and free daily claims.  
• To Display Winners: To ensure transparency, winning UIDs may be publicly displayed on the app’s dashboard and history pages. These identifiers are anonymous and do not reveal any personal information.

3. Eligibility and Access  
SevenO'Clock Drop is designed exclusively for Pioneers—verified members of the Pi Network. Only Pioneers can log in, claim the daily free entry, and participate in the sweepstakes. If a non-Pioneer is referred to the app, they will be prompted to sign up for Pi Network before participating.

4. Information We Do Not Collect  
We do not collect, store, or access any of the following:  
• Personal identifiers (name, email, phone number)  
• Pi wallet private keys or balances  
• Location data or device metadata

All payments are securely processed through the Pi SDK. We are only notified of a payment’s success or failure—never the sender’s financial details.

5. Data Storage and Security  
Your UID and entry data are stored securely in our Supabase-hosted database, located in the us-east-1 region of the United States. We implement reasonable safeguards to protect this information from unauthorized access or misuse.

6. Changes to This Policy  
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted directly on this page, along with the revised date.

7. Contact  
For questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the project creator, @cherylochoa, through the Pi Network ecosystem.
